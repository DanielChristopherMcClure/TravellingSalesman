# Sprint 1 - t02 - Bravo Coders

## Goal

## A team effort to build a simple web application!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for demo / customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and a zip of the repo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>1.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

* #3 Resume
* #4 Distance Application

## Daily Scrums

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog
* *README.md*:  *We didn't have a team photo. We might produce one in the future.*
* *team/eName.md*:  *No Comments, everyone completed this part.*
* *Resume*:  *All but 1 team member were able finish the Resume assignment. Was a good learning experience to get into ReactJS and Bootstrap.*
* *Distance Application*:  *We have a distance calculator where the user can give 2 coordinates to locations on earth and the calculator will give the distance. The user can select between Miles and Kilometers*
* *Local File Trip*:  *A local file can be parsed and if the formatting is valid the array of locations, such as the brews.json can be traversed with the distance between each consecutive brewery being calculated and the cumulative round trip distance being held.*


#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog
* *File Type Bug*: *We have a bug where sometimes the file.type of the uploaded file advertises itself as JSON but other times it doesn't. This bug is hard to reproduce but once it happens it doesn't seem to work again. The JSON.Parse call will find an invalid JSON file but we wanted to be able to check on file load.*

#### What went well
* *We worked well as a team.*
* *We were able to split responsibilities.*
* *We were able to communicate and stay active in the process over the last week on Slack and in person.*
* *Everyone wants to see our site look good and function correctly.*
* *Learning the new tools took some time but we feel much more comfortable with them now.*


#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *We found that we started working on the different parts of the project without a base or core to start. We attempted on the last few days to merge everything into a core index.html and it took time away from testing and polishing. Next time we should start on the base/core and then work on the features.*


## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time |  |  |
What we did well | Everyone was responsive and stayed in communication. | Everyone contributed to project and we accomplished what we set out to, and even more than the minimum requirements. | Everyone learned to use new tools when no one on the team was proficient in all of them.
What we need to work on | Organization of team meetings and responsibilities. | Workflow needs more structure, we need to work on the core before the features. | Learning how to use the tools effectively, not just to make the project work.
What we will change next time | Spend more time working together as a team as opposed to trying to bring all our separate parts together at the end. | Establish priorities early in the sprint and work on the common core/base first. | Work together to figure out the newer tools so we all are on a more similar level.
